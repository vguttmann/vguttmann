Hey there! I'm a CS/AI student from Germany who likes to do weird stuff with computers. Sometimes, I even finish projects.
Yes, I'm very bad at completely finishing projects, and yes, you absolutely should ask me how X is coming along so I get closer to finishing it.
I'm 100% self-taught, so my motto is "I have no idea what I'm doing and you can't stop me", which has worked pretty well so far.

I'm present in lots of places on the internet, but probably the easiest way to get ahold of me is to shoot me a DM on Twitter if you have any questions or want to contact me for any other reason.
